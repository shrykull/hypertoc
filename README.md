==========
Game Rules
==========

To get you started, we made a damn small instruction.

1) There are nine fields (the big ones!).

2) Within each field there are another nine smaller fields.

3) TicTacToe each big field (TicTacToe is a verb now), but be aware of the fact that where you set your cross 
   or circle (on a small field) your opponent has to continue in the corresponding big field.

4) If a field was won by you or your opponent once someone gets there he/she has the
   privilege to choose where to set his/her next cross/circle.

5) The winner is the one who wins the TicTacToe on the big fields.

To create a draw use: 
OXX
XOO
OXX
