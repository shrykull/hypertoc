Game Rules
==========

To get you started, we made a damn small instruction.

1) There are nine fields (the big ones!).

2) Within each field there are another nine smaller fields.

3) TicTacToe each big field (TicTacToe is a verb now), but be aware of the fact that where you set your cross 
   or circle (on a small field) your opponent has to continue in the corresponding big field.

4) If a field was won by you or your opponent once someone gets there he/she has the
   privilege to choose where to set his/her next cross/circle.

5) The winner is the one who wins the TicTacToe on the big fields.

To create a draw use: 
OXX
XOO
OXX

========================================
Requirements for node.js hypertoc server
========================================
* npm install bl
* npm install node-uuid
* npm install concat-stream
* forward your node.js port (default is 8989) to /api/ on your domain
* Only needed for code tests
  * npm install unit.js
  * npm install mocha
  
Creating an automated installation script (eg NPM) is still a TODO for me.

Happy tocking!
